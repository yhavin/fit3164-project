                <h1 class="page-title">Welcome to the coaching decision analysis</h1> <br>
                   <p><img src="https://resources.saints.com.au/photo-resources/2023/05/10/08ffb24b-9621-4bf0-94e9-7262c1fe66df/qgWZ0Rq4.jpg?width=2480"> </p>
                   <br>
                   We have employed 100 Events Testing and other rigorous data science techniques to classify the 92 coaching decisions as good or bad, i.e., successful or unsuccessful. The 100 Events Test analyses the effect of the coaching decision on the next 100 transactions/events in the football match to determine success. The change in scoring margin, from the time of the decision compared to after 100 events, was used in our analysis to classify decisions as good or bad, and we then delved into possible causes and associations of success.

                    There are of course manifold methods -- besides change in margin after 100 events -- to determine success of a coaching decision in such a dynamic and fast-moving game as Australian Rules Football. Additionally, our dataset only includes coaching decisions from six games, which makes the sample size of only medium size. 
                    <br><br>Thus, it is imperative to read the following analysis with this understanding, and to give adequate -- but not conclusive -- credence to the results presented.
                    
                    With this in mind, we are pleased to present our analysis of the 92 coaching decisions made by the St Kilda Football Club coaching team during six games of the 2022 season.

                            <p>This area chart visualises decision success rates based on different levels of effective disposal in the events following the decision. 
                                <br><br>Effective disposal rate is a measure between 0 and 1 indicating the proportion of disposals that were done to the advantage of St Kilda, with 0 being completely ineffective and 1 being perfect. 
                                Based on football knowledge, it is plausible that effective disposal can lead to scoring, which affects margin positively and thus success of a decision. 
                                <br><br>Our analysis found that decisions whose disposals were in the two higher effectiveness brackets (0.8401 - 0.9600 and 0.9601 - 1.0000) saw success rates of 71.43% and 66.67%. This is compared to lower success rates (53.85% and 44.90%) in the 0.6001 - 0.7200 and 0.7201 - 0.8400 disposal effectiveness brackets respectively. 
                                <br><br>These results are suggestive of a positive link between higher disposal effectiveness and decision success. Interestingly, the lowest effectivness bracket (0.0000 - 0.6000) saw decision success of 66.67% as well.

                            <p>This line chart illustrates decision success rates based on different levels of pressure applied by St Kilda players on their opponents. 
                                <br><br>Pressure occurs when a player is nearby or tackling the opponent, thus causing difficulty to the opponent and often leading to ineffective disposal of the other team and turnovers. It is thus plausible that higher pressure applied to the opposing team could be a factor in decision success. 
                                <br><br>However, from our analysis, we can see a trend in the opposite direction, where decisions whose subsequent events included higher average pressure points often ended up being less successful. This is at first glance counterintuitive, however there are possible explanations, such as the notion that applying intense pressure can cause fatigue, and thus even when the opposing team turns the ball over, St Kilda players find it difficult to score well.
