 * headroom.js v0.4.0 - Give your page some headroom. Hide your header until you need it
 * Copyright (c) 2014 Nick Williams - http://wicky.nillia.ms/headroom.js
 * License: MIT
 The code is a jQuery/Zepto plugin for creating a "headroom" effect on a webpage. 
 This means that the header of the webpage will hide until it is needed, giving more screen real estate to the content. 
 The plugin is based on the Headroom.js library and uses its default options unless overridden by the user. 
 The plugin is initialized on all elements with the "data-headroom" attribute, and can also be initialized on specific elements using jQuery/Zepto. 
 The plugin can be used to customize the behavior of the header based on different events such as scrolling or resizing.
